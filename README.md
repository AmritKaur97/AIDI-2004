# AIDI-2004

This program demonstrates basic list operations such as finding maximum and minimum values, sorting, and checking for perfect squares.

1. maximum_value(lst): This function takes a list (lst) as input and returns the maximum value in the list using the max() function.

2. minimum_value(lst): This function takes a list (lst) as input and returns the minimum value in the list using the min() function.

3. sort_list_ascending(lst): This function takes a list (lst) as input and returns a new list with the elements sorted in ascending order using the sorted() function.

4. is_perfect_square(number): This function takes a number (number) as input and checks if it is a perfect square. It calculates the square    root of the number using the exponentiation operator (**) and checks if the square root is an integer.
